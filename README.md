# Flutter BottomSheet With SnackBar

An approach how [BottomSheet](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showModalBottomSheet.html) should works with [SnackBars](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/snackbars) on Flutter.

## What does it mean?

I found this issue trying to put an SnackBar above BottomSheet, and after search a lot, even on the Flutter's Github (see: [#63254](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/63254) and [#80934](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/80934)) I didn't find a solution that worked for my case, so I decided to develop this one and share it here. I called "BottomSheet With SnackBar" ðŸ˜…, well, not very creative... See the behavior bellow.

## Behavior comparison between the default solution and my solution:
